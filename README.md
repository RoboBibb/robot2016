2016 robot code for Robobibb (FRC team #4941) 

# Rules for editing:
 - Put all changes in your commit
 - I recommend you install eclipse to take full advantage of it's syntax highlighting, error detection, and integrated documentation. if you need a text editor.
 - Include lots of comments
 - a great person once said "good code explains itself" : use self-explanatory names, syntax, etc. and write code that is easy to read.
 - KISS = Keep It Simple Stupid
 - Don't change something that will work unless performance would be improved. (even so, remember KISS)
